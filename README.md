# TypeRip
Web-based Adobe TypeKit font ripper (Updated Oct 16th, 2018)
## [Get It Here](http://codezombie.github.io/TypeRip/)

### How to use it
  1. Enter a [TypeKit](https://typekit.com/fonts/) font family url into the bar, and press enter or click 'rip fonts'
  2. Click on the font to show an expanded preview and editable workspace for that font.
  3. Click "download" to save the font to your disk.
  4. You may need to use a separate tool to convert the font file in order to get your operating system to recognize it. [Transfonter.org](https://transfonter.org/) seems to do the job well.
  4. That's it.
